''' 
    My thought process here. I need to do several tasks, I will work through them one by one.
    I will also need to find some external web scrapping libraries to do some of them, so I will be doing that later on.
    My first task for Jarvis will be finding if Randall Munroe has posted a new blog on his xkcd forum. Jarvis will provide me 
    with the latest article on the xkcd blog. So I guess I will
    need web scraping starting my first task.
